# Welcome to rows documentation!

No matter in which format your tabular data is: `rows` will import it,
automatically detect types and give you high-level Python objects so you can
start **working with the data** instead of **trying to parse it**. It is also
locale-and-unicode aware. :)

Have you ever lost your precious time reading a CSV that had a different
dialect? Or trying to learn a whole new library API to read a new tabular data
format your customer just sent? You've got gray hair when trying to access
some data and the only answer was `UnicodeDecodeError`? So,
[rows][rows] was custom made for you - run `pip install rows` and be happy! :-)

The library is officialy supported on Python versions 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6 (but may
work on other versions too).

> Note: if you're using [rows][rows] in some project please [tell
> us][rows-issue-103]! :-)
